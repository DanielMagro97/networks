  "starting_proposal_id": "1",
  "deposits": null,
  "votes": null,

  }
},
```

## Staking params

```
"staking": {
  "pool": {
    "not_bonded_tokens": "0",
    "bonded_tokens": "0"
  },
  "params": {
    "unbonding_time": "259200000000000", // 3 days
    "max_validators": 32,

    "downtime_jail_duration": "600000000000", // 10min
    "slash_fraction_double_sign": "0.050000000000000000",
